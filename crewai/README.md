# CrewAI

This was an attempt to create a Crew using [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) to create a meal plan, recipe list, and shopping list for a client based on their dietary needs. The nutritionist is given tools to precisely calculate the nutritional needs of the user based on `activity level, age, weight, gender, height`.

Using CrewAI didn't seem to work very well. Maybe with some tinkering it could work, but it is a bit excessive if all that is needed is function calling.
